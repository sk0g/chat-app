# ChatApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2.

# Repository

### Server

The server is written in Node.js, and the files are at the top level of the repository. These are: 

* server.js
* app.js
* /www folder, used for storing all associated files (including routes and data)

### Angular

All other files are Angular related.

Further separation of these folders would have been better, might switch the directory format for the next submission.

# Responsibilities

The Node server provides a RESTful API, while the Angular front end interfaces with this API to fetch, update and delete data.
